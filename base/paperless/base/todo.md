# Todo

- Create a global command on my workstation called "pl"
  - This will accept one argument: an existing file in the current directory.
  - It will then rsync that file to the paperless /mnt/paperless/consume on the cluster host. 
  - Eventually it would be nice have that mount be a remote mount on the NAS.
